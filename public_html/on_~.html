          <p>For now, I wouldn't say I'm disappointed in the

        <p>Chances are, anyone reading this is already cognizant of
        the "tildeverse". For the reader who
        isn't, <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain">Paul Ford</a>
        explains the origins of <a href=http://tilde.club/>tilde.club</a>, the
        prototype for the servers comprising the "tildeverse", in
        a <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">Medium.com post from October 9th, 2014</a>.
		His inspiration for founding this experiment was the punctuation mark '~'.
		In particular, he was inspired by a usage of '~' in which
		"You use tildes instead of colons or dashes" because "it’s
		more like handwriting."  This amounts to a
		modification in conventions of mechanical communication to
        give signs of the author's humanity. </p>

		<p>The present document
		is composed of excerpts and remarks that relate the etymology of
		'~' to the thoughts of some tilde users. It is an
		ongoing meditation (meaning it will continue to be updated and refined)
		on the nature and potential of the "tilde fad" (as <a href="tilde.town/~datagrok">~datagrok</a> calls it).

        <h2>"~ is shorthand for 'my home directory'"</h2>

          <p>The early personal web grew up around these little “tilde
          sites”; that’s what preceded blogging. The “~” is a little
          like the “@” on Twitter—a shortcut that says: “Here is a
          person.” (<a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">Paul

        <p>In Vim, I just discovered, &#8216;~&#8217; toggles a
          character&#8217;s case.  I&#8217;m a character who wants my
          case switched about.</p>

        <p>In the tilde.town irc, <a href="tilde.town/~datagrok">~datagrok</a> reminded me that,</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>in unix command-line contexts, ~ is
            shorthand for &#8220;my home directory&#8221; (like
            /home/datagrok) and ~user is shorthand for
            &#8220;(user)&#8217;s home directory.&#8221;</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>which, of course, is central to what we&#8217;re doing.
          Many of us are &#8220;coming home&#8221; to something
          familiar, other&#8217;s (like myself) are making a new
          home somewhere strange. Either way, we&#8217;re making 
          ourselves a home near a root directory. This reminds me of what Heidegger calls
          &#8220;becoming homely in what is one&#8217;s own&#8221;
          (I am wary of the gnarly context in which he
          wrote these lines &#8211; the summer of 1942 &#8211; but I
          take it as a reminder of the fascistic potential latent in
          any radicalization, any &#8220;return to the root&#8221;). 
          Essential to the process of "becoming homely" is the challenge and difficulty it poses:
        </p>

        <blockquote> <p>...one&#8217;s own, finding one&#8217;s own, and
            appropriating what one has found as one&#8217;s own, is
            not that which is most self-evident or easiest but
            remains what is most difficult. (Heidegger,
            <em>Höldelrin&#8217;s Hymn &#8220;The Ister&#8221;</em>, §9)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>"~ itself represents an -n-"</h2>
        <p>Becoming at home is one of the most difficult challenges we face:
          whether it be with ourselves, amongst others, on the web, or on this planet.
          Being at home doesn't amount to immersion in the familiar. One of Heidegger's basic ideas is 
          that we don't know what it means to be at home. We can't know, because it's something
          we figure out in the process of making it happen, and making ourselves at home requires
          a detour through the foreign.</p>

        <p>We&#8217;re reconnecting with the roots of this medium &#8211; a necessary
          step in any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique">critique</a>. What
          has been shouldn&#8217;t decide what will come, but we should, of course, be
          mindful. Forefront in my mind is the thought that &#8220;the next big
          thing&#8221; is probably not the one I want.</p>

        <p>The <em>~</em> used to be a sign of something excluded that was slipped around the contours
          of what remained. It was a special case of inscription; <em>precisely</em>, a
          heading placed above the normal text, announcing something it
          implicitly contained:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>tilde (n.) <br> 1864, from Spanish, metathesis of Catalan <em>title</em>,
            from vernacular form of Medieval Latin <em>titulus</em> &#8220;stroke over an
            abridged word to indicate missing letters,&#8221; a specialized sense of
            Latin <em>titulus</em>, literally &#8220;inscription, heading&#8221; (see
            <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tittle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0">title</a>
            (n.)). The mark itself represents an -n- and was used in Medieval
            Latin manuscripts in an abridged word over a preceding letter to
            indicate a missing -n- and save
            space. (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=tilde&amp;searchmode=none">etymonline</a>)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>&#8216;Tilde&#8217; is &#8216;title&#8217; rearranged: </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Metathesis (/məˈtæθəsɪs/; from Greek μετάθεσις, from μετατίθημι &#8220;I
            put in a different order&#8221;; Latin: trānspositiō) is the re-arranging
            of sounds or syllables in a word, or of words in a sentence. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metathesis_(linguistics)">wikipedia</a>) </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I reiterate <a href="http://tilde.town/~datagrok/">~datagrok</a>&#8217;s question,</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>What should we keep, and what may we safely discard, from this
            re-examination of the early web?
            (<a href="http://tilde.town/~datagrok/#october-14-2014">~datagrok</a>)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and I propose this refinement: what might we rearrange? We might even
          reconfigure the expectation that <em>this</em> become a certain kind of
          thing. We&#8217;ve accepted invitations to collaborate in the transformation
          of a stored-program computer. Universal computation is in our
          hands and those hands are linking&#8230;</p>
