  <p>Each thing has its word, but the word has become a thing by
  itself. Why shouldn't I find it? Why can't a tree be called
  Pluplusch, and Pluplubasch when it has been raining? The word, the
  word, the word outside your domain, your stuffiness, this laughable
  impotence, your stupendous smugness, outside all the parrotry of
  your self-evident limitedness. The word, gentlemen, is a public
  concern of the first importance. (Hugo

<h2>TaDas</h2>
  <h3>Initial draft of Html & JavaScript for a tilde.town web
  ring.</h3>
    <p><a href="http://tilde.town/~nick">~nick</a> already has
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~nick/explore.html">an
      implementation</a> of a random link generator for tilde.town
      users. It is in vanilla JavaScript and certain to be more
      efficient and employ better practices than my own.  You should
      probably use this instead.
    </p>
    <p>My implementation generates a random link to a tilde.town user
      and a random link to another tilde box. You can see an example
      of its operation at the bottom of my <a href="/~um">home
      page</a>. The code is available on github (and in my public_html
      directory): </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/tilde_ring.html">the
      html</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/js/tilde_ring.js">the
      javascript</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want this on your page, it should suffice to drop the
      html wherever you'd like it. Forks and pulls are welcome, as is
      any manner of criticism on the code or approach. The thing
      relies on data generated
      by <a href="http://tilde.town/~dan">~dan</a> and
      <a href="http://tilde.club/~pfhawkins/">~pfhawkins</a>.
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~datagrok">~datagrock</a>,
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a> and others on
      irc were a tremendous help.</p>
    <p>My bit of code generates a link to a tilde.town user and a
      random link to another tilde box.  It is a flawed implementation
      and very bare-bones. Here is a list of its shortcomings:
      <ul>
        <li>It links jQuery. It links through the Google CDN so, I've
          been given to understand, it's probably already cached by
          browsers. But it should be reduced to vanilla
          JavaScript</li>
        <li>It consists of two text links: no graphics no
        nothing.</li>
        <li>It creates random links to tilde.town users. It's not
          ring-like since there's no opt-in and, as of now, only one
          other page has a similar gadget on their page,
          <a href="http://tilde.town/~nick">~nick</a>. (as <a href="http://tilde.town/~dan">~dan</a>
          pointed on irc).</li>
        <li>I hope this will eventually be a universal html widget
          that can be dropped into a ~users page on any known box in
          the tildeverse, and it will generate links to their
          neighbors and to other boxes. It doesn't do this yet. ~dan
          and I have been talking.</li></ul>

  <li>Figure out a way to manage my site.</li>
  <li> <blockquote>
      <p>If you are young and new to Linux and looking for an
        assignment &#8230; go find every programming language on this
        system and learn about each one of them. &#8230; Maybe write a
        one-line description of each language. &#8230; For extra
        credit, don&#8217;t write anything&#8212;but use the
        system&#8217;s own information to write it for
        you. (<a href="http://tilde.club/~ford/">~ford</a>, October

<li>Lamentations section</li>
      <li>Implement site structure:
        <ul>
          <li>Decentered, tightly linked, essays and aphorisms, bound
          by tags, and relations of terms.</li>
          <li>Key terms (called "concepts") given canonical
          definitions, which are visible on mouse hovering over term
          (or, better, in a specified area of the page, more suitable
          for mouse navigation.)</li>
          <li>to "bring grateful release form the constraint of linear
          exposition. Cross-references abound, but they refer forward
          and backward indiscriminately" (Quine, <em>Quiddities</em>,
          Preface).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

  <li>Linkify tilde names: a utility that monitors &#8216;~*&#8217;
  patterns, and links to the ~user within the relevant
  collective. (Just like the twitter &#8216;@&#8217; and Reddit
  &#8216;/u/&#8217;).

    <ul>
      <li>Is this a bad idea? Being a little utility, users&#8217;
        could choose to run the script or not.</li>
      <li>Would mimicking this feature of social networks mean
        capitulating to the pressure to become on?</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Tilde report: scrape pages on tilde servers, extract sentences
    with &#8216;~&#8217; or &#8216;tilde&#8217;, post to a stream of
    updates linking to the source.
    <ul>
      <li>Is this just the stream of data scrolling into oblivion,
        eloquently described by
        (<a href="http://tilde.town/~datagrok/">~datagrok</a>)?</li>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tilde_fortune">@tilde_fortune</a>
        is doing approximately this, but with apparently any
        sentences, posted to twitter. (Also, tilde_fortune appears to
        post text taken from any time, even after the page might have
        changed.)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Recommended cultural capital: (books, music, art, etc)</li>
  <li>Recommended techno capital</li>
  <li>"tilde.town connsonance": scan user pages for sentences
    containing n words in common, or in a row: juxtapose (probably a
    Prolog project)</li>
  <li>"tilde.town dissonance": scan user pages for <em>x</em>
    and <em>is not x</em> or other negation of <em>x</em>: juxtapose.
