    <p>I aim to offer text worthy of rereading. If these pages find readers,
      I hope they'll sometimes return: I hope they return for rereading
      as well as looking for something new.</p>
    <p>Whatever form these pages assume, it will not be a blog. Every
      page is subject to constant revision and the only way to
      discover if there's new content will be to revisit and
      re-explore the site. If the texts I offer are worth reading,
      they're worth rereading. If a reader doesn't remember a text
      well enough to know if it's been read before, then they didn't
      read it well in the first place. If these texts aren't worth
      reading well, then they aren't worth reading at all; for
      I'll recount no news, no confessions, and little in the nature of
      fact. (This isn't really a testament to my estimation of my own
      writing, which is rather low: I expect only 1/3 of the writing
      will be my own; the bulk will be excerpted from sources I
      study.)</p>
    <p>Today, I discovered P. F. Hawkins' (<a href="http://tilde.club/~">~pfhawkins</a>)
      project <a href="http://hypervers.es/">hypervers.es</a>. It
      is pursuing a similar aim, according to its
      <a href="http://hypervers.es/colophon.html">colophone</a>.
      Although it is very much further advanced than this project,
      and therefore a good source of inspiration.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In Greece, [...] the muses were supposed to be ventriloquists with
        the poet just as medium, the dummy. Hölderlin said that in modern
        times, when the gods have fled, poetry is what is written in the place
        of that silence, the poet as a medium without an origin, nothing prior
        to mediate. (E. Kelley)</p>
