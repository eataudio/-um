    <p>I aim to offer text worthy of rereading. If these pages find readers,
      I hope they'll sometimes return: I hope they return for rereading
      as well as looking for something new.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In Greece, [...] the muses were supposed to be ventriloquists with
        the poet just as medium, the dummy. Holderlin said that in modern
        times, when the gods have fled, poetry is what is written in the place
        of that silence, the poet as a medium without an origin, nothing prior
        to mediate. (E. Kelley)</p>

    <h2>to do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up site generating software (probably Hakyll)</li>
      <li>Lamentations section</li>
      <li>Implement site structure:
        <ul>
          <li>Decentered, tightly linked, essays and aphorisms, bound by tags, and relations of terms.</li>
          <li>Key terms (called "concepts") given canonical definitions, which are visible on mouse hovering over term (or, better, in a specified area of the page, more suitable for mouse navigation.)</li>
          <li>to "bring grateful release form the constraint of linear exposition. Cross-references abound, but they refer forward and backward indiscriminately" (Quine, <em>Quiddities</em>, Preface).</li>
        </ul>

      <li> <blockquote>
          <p>If you are young and new to Linux and looking for an assignment
            &#8230; go find every programming language on this system and learn about
            each one of them. &#8230; Maybe write a one-line description of each
            language. &#8230; For extra credit, don&#8217;t write anything&#8212;but use the
            system&#8217;s own information to write it for
            you. (<a href="http://tilde.club/~ford/">~ford</a>, October 24, 2014).</p>
      </blockquote></li>
      <li>Linkify tilde names: a utility that monitors &#8216;~*&#8217; patterns, and
        links to the ~user within the relevant collective. (Just like the
        twitter &#8216;@&#8217; and Reddit &#8216;/u/&#8217;).

        <ul>
          <li>Is this a bad idea? Being a little utility, users&#8217; could choose
            to run the script or not.</li>
          <li>Would mimicking this feature of social networks mean
            capitulating to the pressure to become on?</li> 
      </ul></li>
      <li>Tilde report: scrape pages on tilde servers, extract sentences with
        &#8216;~&#8217; or &#8216;tilde&#8217;, post to a stream of updates linking to the source.

        <ul>
          <li>Is this just the stream of data scrolling into oblivion,
            eloquently described by
            (<a href="http://tilde.town/~datagrok/">~datagrok</a>)?</li>
          <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tilde_fortune">@tilde_fortune</a>
            is doing approximately this, but with apparently any sentences,
            posted to twitter.</li>

      <li>Recommended cultural capital: (books, music, art, etc)</li>
      <li>Recommended techno capital</li>
