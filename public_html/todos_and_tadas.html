<blockquote>
  <p>Each thing has its word, but the word has become a thing by
  itself. Why shouldn't I find it? Why can't a tree be called
  Pluplusch, and Pluplubasch when it has been raining? The word, the
  word, the word outside your domain, your stuffiness, this laughable
  impotence, your stupendous smugness, outside all the parrotry of
  your self-evident limitedness. The word, gentlemen, is a public
  concern of the first importance. (Hugo
  Ball, <em><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dada_Manifesto_(1916,_Hugo_Ball)">Dada
  Manifesto</a></em>)

  <h3>Working draft of Html & JavaScript for a tilde.town tilde-ring.</h3>
    <p>At this moment, it consists in an Html div and an external JavaScript file
      which, together, provide three links:
      <ol>
          <li>One to a randomly selected member of the tilde.town web
          ring. A members is anyone who has the tilde.town ring html in their index.html.</li>
          <li>One to a randomly selected tilde.town user, excluding
          any who haven't yet edited their pages.</li>
          <li>One to a randomly generated tilde.box.</li>
      </ol>
      I'm inclined towards removing 2 and 3, replacing
      them with a "join" link, and trying to move 2 and 3 to the front
      page of tilde.town instead. I'm referring to it as a tilde-ring
      because, the tildeverse is something different than the web,
      even if this only generates links to web sites (at the moment).
    </p>
    <p>The code is still in a somewhat rough state. However, you can
      see it at work on my <a href="/~um">home
      page</a>. I can't decide how I should format it or display it. At
      the moment, it is left unstyled and without images so you can
      customize it to suit your preferences. The code is available on github (and in my public_html
      directory): </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/tilde_ring.html">the
      html</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/js/tilde_ring.js">the
      javascript</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want this on your page, it should suffice to drop the
      html wherever you'd like it. Forks and pulls are welcome, as is
      any manner of criticism on the code or approach. The thing
      relies on data generated
      by <a href="http://tilde.town/~dan">~dan</a> and
      <a href="http://tilde.club/~pfhawkins/">~pfhawkins</a>.
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~datagrok">~datagrock</a>,
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~dan">~dan</a>,
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a> and others on
      irc were a tremendous help.</p>
    <p>At present, my bit of code generates 3 links link to a tilde.town user and a
      random link to another tilde box.  It is a flawed implementation
      and very bare-bones. Here is a list of its shortcomings:
      <ul>
        <li>It consists of three text links: no graphics no
        nothing.</li>
        <li>We need a "join" page</li>
        <li>This could eventually be developed into a universal html widget
          that could be dropped into a ~users page on any known box in
          the tildeverse, and it will generate links to their
          neighbors and to other boxes. It doesn't do this yet. ~dan
          and I have been talking.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p><a href="http://tilde.town/~nick">~nick</a> also has
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~nick/explore.html">an
      implementation</a> of a random link generator for tilde.town
      users. 
    </p>

  
<h3>Generated a (flawed) list of the programming language packages available on
  the tilde.town box</h3>
<p><a href="http://tilde.town/~um/languages_on_system.txt">The results.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tilde.club/~ford/">~ford</a> posed the following
  challenge on his tilde.club blog:</p> 
  <blockquote>
      <p>If you are young and new to Linux and looking for an
        assignment &#8230; go find every programming language on this
        system and learn about each one of them. &#8230; Maybe write a
        one-line description of each language. &#8230; For extra
        credit, don&#8217;t write anything&#8212;but use the
        system&#8217;s own information to write it for
        you. (<a href="http://tilde.club/~ford/">~ford</a>, October
        24, 2014).</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>I am a bit too old to be young, but I am new to linux, and I gave it
      a go. I accomplished the task with
      some <a href="https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/projects/languages_on_system/find_languages.prolog">Prolog
        code</a> that pipes in the output of <code>dpkg -l</code> and
      compares and filters that against a file with a list of 256
      programming languages copy-pasted
      from <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/big-list-256-programming">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The code generates several false positives, from languages like
    Icon, Magic, and Processing.</p>

<h2>ToDos</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Figure out a way to manage my site.</li>
<li>Lamentations section</li>
      <li>Implement site structure:
        <ul>
          <li>Decentered, tightly linked, essays and aphorisms, bound
          by tags, and relations of terms.</li>
          <li>Key terms (called "concepts") given canonical
          definitions, which are visible on mouse hovering over term
          (or, better, in a specified area of the page, more suitable
          for mouse navigation.)</li>
          <li>to "bring grateful release form the constraint of linear
          exposition. Cross-references abound, but they refer forward
          and backward indiscriminately" (Quine, <em>Quiddities</em>,
          Preface).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

  <li>Linkify tilde names: a utility that monitors &#8216;~*&#8217;
  patterns, and links to the ~user within the relevant
  collective. (Just like the twitter &#8216;@&#8217; and Reddit
  &#8216;/u/&#8217;).

    <ul>
      <li>Is this a bad idea? Being a little utility, users&#8217;
        could choose to run the script or not.</li>
      <li>Would mimicking this feature of social networks mean
        capitulating to the pressure to become on?</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Tilde report: scrape pages on tilde servers, extract sentences
    with &#8216;~&#8217; or &#8216;tilde&#8217;, post to a stream of
    updates linking to the source.
    <ul>
      <li>Is this just the stream of data scrolling into oblivion,
        eloquently described by
        (<a href="http://tilde.town/~datagrok/">~datagrok</a>)?</li>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tilde_fortune">@tilde_fortune</a>
        is doing approximately this, but with apparently any
        sentences, posted to twitter. (Also, tilde_fortune appears to
        post text taken from any time, even after the page might have
        changed.)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Recommended cultural capital: (books, music, art, etc)</li>
  <li>Recommended techno capital</li>
  <li>"tilde.town connsonance": scan user pages for sentences
    containing n words in common, or in a row: juxtapose (probably a
    Prolog project)</li>
  <li>"tilde.town dissonance": scan user pages for <em>x</em>
    and <em>is not x</em> or other negation of <em>x</em>: juxtapose.
