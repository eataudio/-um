This is my tilde.town site. tilde.town is a tilde.club clone (a tilde 
box). If you're curious about tilde things, see [Paul Ford's entry on 
Medium](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf).

It is here partially as a backup, and partially so I can share whatever
javascript and reusable html it contains. At the moment, there are two
items which might be of interest to other tilde.town users:

1. The [HTML snippet](https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/tilde_ring/tilde_ring.html)
for the tilde.town ~ring I made with [~dan](http://tilde.town/~dan/)
(and lots of other help).

2. The
   [JavaScript](https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/js/tilde_ring.js)
   that facilitates 1.
   
This ring stuff is in its initial stage. Recommendations, critiques, and pull
requests welcome.
