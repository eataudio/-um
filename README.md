This is my tilde.town site. tilde.town is a tilde.club clone (a tilde 
box). If you're curious about tilde things, see [Paul Ford's entry on 
Medium](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf).

It is here partially as a backup, and partially so I can share whatever
javascript and reusable html it contains. At the moment, there are two
items which might be of interest to other tilde.town users:

1. An [HTML snippet](https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/tilde_ring/tilde_ring.html) that can be dropped into tilde.town sites 
to generate random links to to other tilde.town sites and to 
other tilde boxes.
2. The [JavaScript](https://github.com/aBathologist/-um/blob/master/public_html/js/tilde_ring.js) that facilitates 1, which someone might want to reuse or improve.

This linker (not yet an implementation of a web ring) is in an
initial stage and wants many improvements. The list of their 
problems, planned improvements, a better alternative for the moment,
etc. can be found [here](http://tilde.town/~um/todos_and_tadas.html).
